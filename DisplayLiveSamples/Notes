☐ make sure dlib facial landmark coordinates are on same system as gamescene coordinates
☑ initiate game by detecting open mouth
☐ implement basketball-style parabolic shot for game sprite

☐ BUG - look into collision detections looks like sometimes contact is made but not firing handler; seems like it might be when there is a collision with hammer and while the explosion is excecuting, collisions with the ball are dropped; in that event, may need to somehow handle each collision on a seperate concurrent queue
