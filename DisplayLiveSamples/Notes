☐ make sure dlib facial landmark coordinates are on same system as gamescene coordinates
☑ initiate game by detecting open mouth


☐ Upgrade - implement basketball-style parabolic shot; only handle collisions only when the object and player are "close" enough
☐ Upgrade - save all time high score into NSUserDefaults

☐ BUG - look into collision detections looks like sometimes contact is made but not firing handler; seems like it might be when there is a collision with hammer and while the explosion is excecuting, collisions with the ball are dropped; in that event, may need to somehow handle each collision on a seperate concurrent queue
☐ BUG - look into how i reset categorybitmask to avoid overlapping collisions; seems like the ball is also triggering explosions

☐ UX - should pause camera layer when game is paused
